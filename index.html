                Hey and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Malik and i moved to Richmond,VA last year.
                Originally coming from an Engineering background I'm excited to learn the ins and outs of being
                 a full stack devloper and dream of using  my skills to help others in the future. </br>
                <br>
                I spent my school and high school years in Pakistan which is my Hometown as well and then i moved to China to get Undergraduate Education
                I spent 4 years there graduating as a Petroleum engineering undergrad student.Later on i spent some time in my field
                doing internships on an Onshore Oil-rig and to get some good experience. As i have a lot of friends who belong to 
                web developing field always had me in touch with it. Now that i'm here and i saw alot of opportunities in this
                growing field makes me want to learn about this field.To be honest, its feeling like a vast field and everything jumbling over one
                and another at the moment but i have full faith that through hard work i will get where i want to be and YES! the most important thing
                that i've learned in this field is that PRACTICE is the KEY!<br>
                <br>
                My interest for coding & development began in college as well as in my professional engineering field where i saw many engineers
                having more diverse skills in web developing and in engineering.That made their horizon more broad. Although, I'm still interested
                in My Petroleum Engineering field, I learned it wasn't something I could do forever with a very specific and tight job market. I'm
                excited to hone my skills in the coming months and be able to show off cool projects here on Github. Cheers!
